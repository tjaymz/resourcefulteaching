        <h1>Welcome to Resourceful Teaching!</h1>
        <p>My name is Amy Trujillo, education is my passion.</p>
        <p>I'm the Assistant Principal and Gifted Coordinator at Osceola Science Charter School. I'm passionate about education and creating opportunities for all students to succeed, particularly in STEM fields.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I've worn many hats in education. I've been a Gifted and ELL Advocate, a Science Teacher, and a Curriculum Coordinator. In each of these roles, I've focused on providing equitable access to a high-quality education for all students.</p>
        <p>In my current role as Assistant Principal, I supervise and assess teachers, develop and manage the budget, and assist with the hiring process. I also oversee the school's Special Programs and serve as the Gifted Coordinator. In this capacity, I work to ensure compliance with state and district regulations, and provide high-quality services to gifted students.</p>
        <p>I'm always looking for new ways to improve my practice and support the students I work with. I'm a lifelong learner and I'm committed to making a positive impact on the lives of my students.</p>
        <p>Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
